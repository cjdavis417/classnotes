                        <h4>Cowboy Coders</h4>
                        <p>Coders who don't follow coding best-practices such as a VCS (Version Control System) like GIT.</p>

                        <h3>Why Git, and how version control works.</h3>

                        <p>Git was created in large part to help manage the Linux kernel.</p>
                        <p>Git is a 'distributed' version control system.  This means there is no 'central' repository for any given project; everyone has their own copy of the project they can work with directly.</p>

                        <h4>Repository</h4>
                        <p>The repository is where all the version control information about a project is stored.</p>

                        <h4>Commit</h4>
                        <p>In version control, the finish change to a project is a commit.</p>

                        <h4>Plumbing and Porcelain</h4>
                        <p>Git Commands can be divided into two categories: Plumbing and Porcelain.  The plumbing is the powerful low-level commands that do a lot of the heavy lifting.  Porcelain is the higher level commands that make normal interaction with Git friendly.</p>

                        <h3>Git Ready!</h3>

                        <h4>is Git installed?</h4>
                        <p>Macs, yes.  Linux, yes.  Windows, no.</p>

                        <h4>git --version</h4>
                        <p>tells you what version of git is installed on your system.</p>

                        <h4>git init my_first_repository</h4>
                        <p>This command creates a repository called 'my_first_repository'.</p>
                        <p>Another way to create a repository is to be in your project folder and run the same command WITHOUT a project name.</p>

                        <h4>git add README</h4>
                        <p>this command adds a file to the version control of git.</p>

                        <h4>git commit</h4>
                        <p>commits our changes.  a message window opens up for you to make notes about what is included in the commit.  Best practice is to keep the message short and meaningful.</p>

                        <h4>git commit -a -m "message"</h4>
                        <p>same as above EXCEPT '-a' commits all changes and '-m' allows you to add a message directly without going into an editor to add a message.</p>

                        <h4>git status</h4>
                        <p>shows us the status of our project.</p>

                        <h4>git log</h4>
                        <p>shows a log of all our commits with details.  The long string on top is the commit number.  Usually the first 5 or 6 characters in the commit number will allow you to checkout that commit.</p>

                        <h4>git checkout 7cbef</h4>
                        <p>this puts you in a state of where you were with a past commit.  the '7cbef' is a little bit of info to identify with commit to checkout.  after you check out, you can use the folders and files like being in that state.</p>

                        <h4>cat file1</h4>
                        <p>lets you view the files to see the files to make sure you're in a previous commit.</p>

                        <h4>git checkout master</h4>
                        <p>goes back to present file/ folder structure</p>

                        <h4>git dif lf4sfsd 4sdfsd</h4>
                        <p>this command lets you see what was changed between the commits.</p>

                        <h3>Beginning to Branch</h3>

                        <h4>Master</h4>
                        <p>The master branch is always the version deployed in production.</p>

                        <h4>git branch foo_feature</h4>
                        <p>creates a branch named foo_feature</p>

                        <h4>git checkout foo_feature</h4>
                        <p>Switchhes to branch named foo_feature.  Notice this is the same command used to switch to a particular commit.</p>

                        <h4>git checkout -b branchName</h4>
                        <p>this command uses the '-b' argument to create a new branch and switch to it at the same time.</p>

                        <h3>Managing Our Branching</h3>

                        <h4>git branch</h4>
                        <p>this command will list all your branches.</p>

                        <h4>git branch -D branchName</h4>
                        <p>This command will delete the named branch.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction to Merging</h3>

                        <h4>git merge branchName</h4>
                        <p>Be on the branch you want to merge to.  This command will merge the branchName to the one you are currantly on.  Then you can use command 'git log' to verify the merge happened and the log should show the commits that were in the branchName.</p>

                        <h4>Merge Conficts</h4>
                        <p>simplest method for fixing a conflict is to edit the conflicting file and fix problem.</p>

                        <h3>Working with Remote Repositories</h3>

                        <h4>Push / Pull</h4>
                        <p>The act of sending changes to and from remote repositories in Git.</p>

                        <h4>Reasons for having a Remote Repository</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You intend to work on the project with a team of other contributors.</li>
                            <li>You'd like a remote copy of your project history in case something happens to the repository on your computer.</li>
                            <li>You'd like to have an authoritiative, "central" version of the project you're working on, and a remote repository on the neutral server serves that purpose.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Cloning</h4>
                        <p>The act of creating a new repository that is a copy of another one.</p>

                        <h4>Central Remote Repositories</h4>
                        <p>It is good form to use a 'central' remote repository to help organize your project workflow; everyone on the team has the most up-to-date code and information.</p>

                        <h4>Histories</h4>
                        <p>You can merge history between two different copies of a repository much in the same way you would merge history between two branches in the same repository.</p>

                        <h3>Cloning</h3>

                        <h4>git clone repositoryName myCloneProject</h4>
                        <p>This command clones the repository 'repositoryName' and names the clone 'myCloneProject'.<br>
                        Creating a clone makes a link to the original.  (the original doesn't know the remote exists)</p>

                        <h4>git remote</h4>
                        <p>Inside of the clone, 'myCloneProject', this command will show all the remotes available to this remote repository.</p>
                    
                        <h4>git remote add cloneName ~/path</h4>
                        <p>Using this command, the original is linked to the clone.  They can talk to each other.<br>
                        Run 'git remote' to verify that it worked.</p>

                        <h3> Pushing and Pulling</h3>

                        <h4>git push origin branch</h4>
                        <p>When pushing to the remote, use 'git push origin' and the branch name you're working on.</p>

                        <h4>git pull origin branch</h4>
                        <p>pull from the origin</p>

                        <h3>A Day in the Life of a Git</h3>

                        <h4>Master Branch</h4>
                        <p>The canonical branch.  This is finished, working, and ready to go into the production version of the site.</p>

                        <h4>Feature Branches</h4>
                        <p>Any time you add a new feature, big refactor/redesign, or substantial change, always make a branch.</p>
                    </article>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Git-Flow</h3>

                        <p>use this comand to start new feature.</p>

                        <h4>git flow feature finish feature_name</h4>
                        <p>It will merge feature branch into intergration.</p>

                        <h4>git flow hotfix start a_bug</h4>
                        <p>this creates a branch based on master because that is what you want to hotfix.</p>
