# Class Notes #
#### This is a website I'm making based on my notes from a Front End Web Development course I'm taking through [Code Louisville](https://www.codelouisville.org). ####

### Javascript code to demonstrate ###
  1. [loops page](../loops.html)
    * [while loop](../loops.html#whilemini)
    * [do...while loop](../loops.html#dowhilemini)
    * [for loop](../loops.html#formini)
  2. [nav.js](../scripts/nav.js)
    * I built the navigation with JS because i was starting to have several pages and i figured in the longrun, it would be easier and time-saving to be able to add the one new page to the script and it would auto update to all the other pages.
